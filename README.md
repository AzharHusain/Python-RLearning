This repository is basic learning examples of my work while studying python and R for data analysis.

# Chapter 1. Installation and basic setup

## Python Setup

All the details related to installation of Python along with Jupyter notebook, is given in directory CH1_InstallationAndSetup. I have also included here how to download two famous library of python i.e pandas and numpy

R setup and installation of dplyr and rattle packages is given in CH1_InstallationAndSetup directory. R is one of the oldest language in statistical programming and has largest community around the globe. In current environment it immediate rival is Python which is growing at great pace. Still availability of IDE(Integerated Development Environment) like R Studio, R markdown for reproducible research and shiny for web app and dashboard development its is one of the most favoured one.
